# A concise how-to guide

## 0. Set up a repository

`git init` should do the job. Commit early and often.

## 1. Understand the problem

Use Generally Useful Resources(TM) to find out more information about what you're facing. If you need, use paper, draw diagrams, bite pencils.

If the problem seems too difficult, try to simplify it, find a special case that may be easier to design and implement. If it seems too easy, generalise, invent more complicated variations, perhaps try to combine with other problems.

## 2. Implement

Start with whatever language you know best or feel most comfortable with. If the problem is easy, pick a language you've never used before or one that you don't know too well yet. Don't be afraid to write ugly or nonidiomatic code as long as you understand what's going on. You can clear up the mess later.

## 3. Test

Write tests that check both the ordinary and the exceptional cases of your program. Compile/interpret/eval whatever you've written and run the tests. Find bugs, fix them and repeat. Again, commit often lest your progress disappear into the abbys.

## 4. Reimplement

Now that you have a reference implementation, you can go wild. Reimplement the task in different language this time, perhaps the one you've been meaning to learn since years ago. Try to achieve the same outcome using different techniques, use different idioms. Try to make the code as short as possible or the contrary.
